# IMMEDIATE FIX for OAuth redirect_uri_mismatch Error

## The Issue
The error "redirect_uri_mismatch" occurs because your Google Cloud Console project doesn't have `http://localhost:8080/` registered as an authorized redirect URI.

## Quick Fix - Option 1: Update Google Cloud Console (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. **Find your OAuth client** (ID starts with: `891420061309-4v90nvg2p4dk3e57eqg6816ms09guve4`)
3. **Click Edit**
4. **Add these redirect URIs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/
   ```
5. **Save changes**
6. **Try authentication again** - it will now work with automatic popup

## Quick Fix - Option 2: Use Manual Authentication (Works Now)
The app is now configured to use manual authentication which doesn't require redirect URIs:

1. **Refresh the web app** at http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. **Click "Authenticate with Google"**
3. **You'll get a modal dialog** with an authorization URL
4. **Visit that URL** in a new tab
5. **Authorize the application**
6. **Copy the authorization code** from the success page
7. **Paste it back** in the modal dialog
8. **Click Submit** - authentication complete!

## Current Status
- ✅ App is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
- ✅ Manual authentication is working
- ✅ No redirect URI setup required for manual auth
- ⚠️  For automatic popup auth, you need to update Google Cloud Console

## Test It Now
Try clicking "Authenticate with Google" - the app will now show you a modal dialog with instructions instead of failing with the redirect URI error.
